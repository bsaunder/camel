# Camel on EAP 6.x
These examples are of Camel running on JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1 or higher using the Apache Camel distribution that is shipped with JBoss Fuse 6.1. Specifically they use Camel version 2.12.0.redhat-611412.

# Deploying Camel
To deploy Camel on the EAP platform it is recommended that you deplot the Camel libraries as a module on EAP. For information on how to create a Camel module for EAP, you can review (Christian Posta's blog)[http://www.christianposta.com/blog/?p=396].
